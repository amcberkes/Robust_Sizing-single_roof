'''
We need to generate a list of the following type:
t_start, t_end, soc_arrival

for a period  of one year 365 days.

1 - Generate functions for 24h and let it run 365 days. distinguish between weekdays and weekends, 
so have different fucntions for that.

2 - for each WFH type, run the functions 365 times to get a time series, by putting in the corresponding parameters.

'''


# function for arrival time 



# function for departure time, dependent on arrval


# function for SOC


# take all 3 vars together and save them in the file
